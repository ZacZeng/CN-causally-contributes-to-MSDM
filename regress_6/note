linear regression by minimizing the vertical distance between the fitted line and the raw data

script gives R, p, slope, 95% confident interval and intercept.

========================================

There is no need to do all the stuffs in the original codes (btw, the codes suck).

Minimizing vertical distance between the fitting line and the raw data
is EQUIVALENT to finding the direction of the first principal component!

Therefore, we only need three lines:

coeff = pca([xx yy]);
k = coeff(2) / coeff(1);
b = mean(yy)- k * mean(xx);

When we do bootstrapping, the running time decreases from 15s to 0.3s!
